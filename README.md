## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the entire Elcyckel project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Running the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/hafsaChy/vteam.git <!-- cd server -->```

2. Build and start the Docker containers:
```bash setup.bash up```
or 
```./setup.bash up```

It builds the neccessary containers and then network starts up. First, mariadb starts and then server starts. The express server has the url ```http://localhost:3050/```. The client url is ```http://localhost:3000/``` and webapp can be seen in ```http://localhost:3003/```.

## To shut down the docker containers and network
```
./setup.bash down
```
